                                     Newsletter on LinkedIn Branching Out Do your best work on GitHub GitHub See what others are saying about this topic Open on Linkedin Maintaining your joy in open source May is Maintainer Month and this years theme is the joys of open source maintenance Being a maintainer is hard work but theres also joy in the experience which is sometimes easy to lose sight of Creating things putting them out into the world and seeing other people use and contribute back to them is exhilarating especially when youre first starting out So how do you hold on to the joy over the course of months or years We talked with three open source developers about how they maintain their passion and reignite the spark when needed Meet the panelists Kent C Dodds is a fulltime educator at EpicWebdev  striving to make the world a better place through open source and teaching people to make quality software Among other things he is the creator of Testing Library  Cassidy Williams is a Chicagobased developer and CTO of Contenda  She pursues her passion for open source and helping people be as awesome as they can be by sharing her knowledge through talks  her blog which is open source  and email newsletter  She also created the open source word game Jumblie and is a GitHub Star  Aaron Francis is a software developer content creator and cofounder of Try Hard Studios  Hes also an active contributor to the Laravel Vuejs and Tailwind ecosystems He created the serverless Laravel deployment tool Sidecar and Airdrop  which aims to speed up deployment by skipping asset compilation whenever possible Klint How did it feel when you first got into open source What were those early days like Kent My first pull request was a typo fix in a comment in the Java framework Play From there I started working on a few different things but Genie a library for keyboard controls for web applicationswas the first thing I started getting a lot of attention for I also took over angularformly  which was pretty big What I really came to appreciate pretty quickly is that open source is a lot more about people than it is about code You spend so much time working with humans when youre doing open source Cassidy I started out with typo fixes too I was really excited when I first realized that open source meant I could fix typos and bugs or even work on features It was empowering and made me feel like I was part of the process of making the things I used even if it was small Aaron Yeah I felt more like I was part of a community rather than just consuming open source Those early days were super duper exciting Id watched a lot of people I admired do open source and thought there was some sort of cabal or secret or rite of passage Then I realized I could just do it I could release something or submit a pull request I didnt need permission or initiation It was a lot of fun I learned that people were having similar problems to the ones I was having I saw that my solutions to those problems were helping people that felt great Klint What still sparks joy for you working on OSS Cassidy The most minor things make me so happy with open source Typos are still my favorite thing to fix because its such a simple thing you can do to make a project just a little bit better for everyone You can fix a little copy help with some translation I play the game Go online and Ive made some contributions to the open source website UI  For example if someone deletes their account on the website it used to result in a super long entry in the database It would cause UI problems with the text overflowing in different places I fixed that and it made the experience better These seemingly small actions can have a big impact I do like jumping in on heavier lifts but its really rewarding to make those quick changes Aaron For me its continuing to scratch my own itch and solve my own problems Thats a pretty important and often overlooked aspect of open source Its tempting to become captured by the consumers of your library or package or whatever youve open sourced and committed to making things you wont use and dont even have an opinion on Theres a certain sense of duty thats required to be a maintainer but if you maintain software you dont use or care about you lose the fire Theres a certain sense of duty thats required to be a maintainer but if you maintain software you dont use or care about you lose the fire Kent Exactly Thats how I avoid burnout I work on the things I need for my own use cases or that I like to work on not because of pressure from other people Thats led me to delegate things to other people Im open about not having enough bandwidth to take something on and let someone else step up It also helps me give the same grace to other maintainers If I find a bug or want a feature Ill let the maintainer know but if they dont fix it I understand its because they have different problems and priorities and I need to find a work around or fix it myself My motivation for my pull requests are pretty practical now because I have a family I want to spend time with Klint What can organizations and companies do to better support maintainers Cassidy All companies should have some sort of fund to help finance the open source projects they rely on There are so many people maintaining things that are core to software around the world and theyre hardly getting paid anything for it because we take it for granted that these libraries exist and will continue existing Were starting to see more companies establish funds including startups that build it into their budget from the beginning Also organizations should encourage their employees who use and contribute to open source to triage issues Label the ones that are good first issues so new people can start contributing Closeout duplicate issues This sort of support can be crucial Kent Funding can come in many forms besides donations If you rely on something and dont want the team behind it to get distracted by their day jobs you can ensure longerterm success by hiring that team and making sure they can keep working on the project without being distracted by the need to work for someone else Of course even big companies cant do that for everything but its a huge help when you can If you cant hire the team outright make sure the engineers on your team are at least given permission and autonomy to contribute back to the projects they use When I was at PayPal I had a lot of autonomy My attitude was that as long as I was pushing the companys mission forward it didnt matter if my work was in a private repo or a public one I think thats an attitude companies and managers can adopt Aaron Besides funding attention is really importanteven if its never going to pay the bills Not a lot of open source authors get into it for the money but its a viable way to market yourself as a developer It gives us the rare opportunity to show the work weve done Companies can support maintainers with newsletter mentions retweets or anything that elevates them and increases job opportunities Maintainers really like to know how people are using their projects so sharing that sort of information in a blog post is helpful Even better let them use your company logo in their readme file Klint Have you ever had to step away from open source If so what brought you back Aaron Yes In my case it wasnt mental burnout I was physically exhausted Wed had our second set of twins our third and fourth children I also had rheumatoid arthritis I wasnt sleeping I just had to step away from the computer for a few months Now that I feel rested again Im getting back to my open source projects Laravel 11 just came out and I have a lot of packages I need to update As for what brought me back I do feel a sense of duty to get them up to date Theres also that marketing angle I mentioned Plus now that Im not coding full time for work open source keeps me in the game I think what it takes to bring people back will depend on why they stepped away in the first place Kent I used to spend a lot more time on open source Id often respond as soon as someone opened an issue and have a fix 5 minutes later But I was spending so much time after hours that it began impacting my relationship with my family and my other work I decided that if Im not personally interested in doing something for the fun of it and Im not using it for work I shouldnt work on it I moved from Angular to React so I wasnt using angularformly at all anymore Nobody else was able to take over the project so that project pretty much died when I moved to React Its still useful and popular but nobody has maintained it over the years I learned a lot from that experience I realized I need to have a succession plan in place if I move on from a project In a more recent project a DOM testing library suite of tools I did a lot better with onboarding contributors If someone said Hey I have this problem and I knew it was pretty straightforward to deal with Id invite them to work on it Eventually I did move on from that testing library Its still actively maintained Its a much more gratifying feeling like I can move on from a project without feeling like I had to keep it going myself Cassidy I havent really stepped back from open source but Ive stepped back from projects mostly my own when the expectations become too much For example I made a task tracking app for my own use I open sourced it and pretty soon other people were using it too At one point it had so many issues I couldnt keep up anymore There were some good ideas but I dont have the time or energy to implement them and theyre not things Ill necessarily use When I go back to something that I previously walked away from its usually just because Im in the mood to code and Ill pick something up and start working on it again Klint When was the last time being a maintainer brought a smile to your face What was it Aaron It always brings a smile to my face when someone says something nice about my work Sometimes someone will randomly tweet that they use one of my libraries It reminds me that there are people out there using things I built and might even have forgotten about Cassidy It sounds so cheesy to say every day but its true I made a word game called Jumblie and people play it every day Seeing people actually play something I built out in the open is just the best Kent I love merging pull requests from other people It might not be something I even need but it makes the project better Seeing people come together and without an extraordinary effort on any one persons part lift heavy objects that we couldnt on our own is what makes me smile The ReadME Project is a GitHub platform dedicated to
